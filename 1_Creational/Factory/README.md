# Factory Design Pattern

# Simple Factory:
## Definition:
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

# Abstract Factory:
## Definition:
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
